# D. Charger

Have you ever wondered if your laptop can control its charger automatically?
<br/>
Have you ever got disconnected from an important meeting or exam cause you just forgot to turn on that silly charger?
<br/>
Have you ever heard that a laptop battery gets damaged if you overcharge it and you always leave the charger turned on, especially while working

No worries, the solution is here, use D. Charger. It will make your laptop control the charger based on battery levels. So, no need to worry. If the battery is low, the charger will turn ON automatically. On the other hand, if the battery is full, the charger will turn OFF.
